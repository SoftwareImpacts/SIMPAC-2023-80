# PCBIR-CV
A Privacy-preserved Content-Based Image Retrieval using Combined Visual Descriptors for Cloud
Secure search and retrieval of encrypted images based on the content is a challenging task. We present a prototype PCBIR-CV that realizes a privacy-preserved content-based image retrieval using combined visual descriptors for cloud environment. The prototype achieves high retrieval precision compared with state-of-the art schemes
  using Corel-10k image dataset. This can be easily incorporated with real-world applications for retrieving encrypted images outsourced in cloud servers.
